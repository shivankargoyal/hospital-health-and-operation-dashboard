🏥 Hospital Health & Operations Dashboard


📌 Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze and monitor hospital operations and health data across multiple dimensions, such as billing, patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital units, and doctor performance.

It provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) that support data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators and healthcare stakeholders.

I got the dataset from kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset ]
